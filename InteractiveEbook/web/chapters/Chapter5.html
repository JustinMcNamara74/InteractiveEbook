<p class="keyPoint">A loop can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatedly. </p>

<p>Suppose that you need to display a string (e.g., <span class="highlightedWord">Welcome to Java!</span>) a hundred times. It would be tedious to have to write the following statement a hundred times:
<margin note>
</p>
<p>problem
<img width="352" height="53" src="Chapter5_image001.jpg"></p>
<p>So, how do you solve this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java provides a powerful construct called a
  <span class="keyTerm">loop</span> that controls how many times an operation or a sequence of operations is performed in succession. Using a loop statement, you simply tell the computer to display a string a hundred times without having to code the print statement a hundred times, as follows:
  <key term>loop
  int count = 0;
  while (count < 100) {
  System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
  count++;
  }
  The variable count is initially 0. The loop checks whether count < 100 is true. If so, it executes the loop body to display the message Welcome to Java! and increments count by 1. It repeatedly executes the loop body until count < 100 becomes false. When count < 100 is false (i.e., when count reaches 100), the loop terminates and the next statement after the loop statement is executed.
  Loops are constructs that control repeated executions of a block of statements. The concept of looping is fundamental to programming. Java provides three types of loop statements: while loops, do-while loops, and for loops.
